"tutorial1"="Welcome to Agnes\n\nLet’s get started! Tap on this note to learn more.\n\nThis is the note view. From here you can read, write, edit and share notes.\n\nWhat anyone would expect from a note app and certainly nothing worth paying for.\n\nNow return to Inbox and I’ll show you what really makes Agnes special.\n\n#tutorial";
"tutorial2"="Slide to archive\n\nWhen you are done with a note slide it to the left to archive it. Ah, gestures!\n\nThe Archive is where you put the notes that don’t need your attention but don’t want to delete. Very much like Mail.\n\nYou can access the Archive from the Index. To return a note to the Inbox, just slide it to the right.\n\n#tutorial";
"tutorial3"="Organise with hashtags\n\nUse hashtags to categorise your notes. These are all tagged #tutorial.\n\nYou can use hashtags anywhere, although they'll work much better if you put them below the title or body.\n\nAs soon as you add one it will appear in the Index. From there you can tap on a hashtag to see all of its unarchived notes.";
"tutorial4"="Reorder, sort, search\n\nTap & hold to order your notes. Tap on the top title to sort them automagically.\n\nAgnes will remember the sort criteria of each list independently. For example, you might want to sort notes about people alphabetically, or things to do by date.\n\nThen there is Search. Pull up down any list to search on it. If you search from the Inbox, you will search all notes.\n\n#tutorial
";
"tutorial5"="Go Pro\n\nAgnes has many features and very few buttons. Discover what else she can do.\n\nFAST HASHTAGS\nStart a note from a hashtag list and the + button will automatically add the hashtag. Or start typing a hashtag and Agnes will suggest it. She’s helpful like that.\n\nSWIPE NAVIGATION\nFrom the Note view, swipe left or right to browse other notes.\n\nSORT TAGS\nIn Index, tap & hold on a tag to reorder it.\n\nINTELLIGENT NOTES\nEmails, links and phone numbers are highlighted automatically and can be interacted with if the keyboard is down. Try it: hpiqueapps@gmail.com.\n\nCHANGE COLORS\nFrom the Index, select Meta and then Settings to change colors.\n\nCHARACTER AND WORD COUNT\nIn the note view, tap on the center of the bottom toolbar to toggle info about the note, such as date and number of characters, words and views.\n\nFULL UNDO SUPPORT\nTap ⚬⚬⚬ or shake the device to undo any change.\n\nEXPORT LISTS\nTap on ⚬⚬⚬ to export the current list. The notes will be saved as a text files and zipped to your email.\n\nIMPORT NOTES\nImport notes into Agnes via iTunes. Both .txt and .zip files are supported.\n\nAnd much more...\n\n#tutorial";
